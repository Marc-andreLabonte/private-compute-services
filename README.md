# Fork of Private Compute Services

This repository is a fork of the original Private Compute Service app from google
[Private Compute Services](https://github.com/google/private-compute-services)


This fork aim to prevent the app from making any HTTP request and log the URL and (if possible) other request details on logcat instead.
